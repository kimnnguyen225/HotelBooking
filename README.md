### Nice to have, before you start:

- IDE, I'm using IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate (paid) 2019 version, so all of the screenshots and modules, settings, etc are based off IntelliJ IDEA but you can Google search for similar options/functions/locations of libraries, etc in your choice of IDE. But IntelliJ IDEA is super-est IDE in my opinion with exposed experience with other IDEs.
- Java JDK 1.8 and Spring boot 2.5.1
- Basic knowledge of open source Tomcat application server
- Helpful if have basic knowledge with MVC (Model View Controller - Database DAO SQL Utility - UI - Controller/Servlets)
- Helpful if you know Maven apache
- Helpful if you know Postman REST client

### What is Spring Boot ?

- It's one of Java best frameworks for building enterprise applications 
- https://start.spring.io/ - you can also bootstrap your application from this website, I create my application from IntelliJ IDEA 

### Why Spring Boot?

- It makes developing production ready applications easy and fast
- No WAR file, we are going to create a Java jar file so that you can deploy to any server
